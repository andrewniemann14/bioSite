              <h4>About</h4>
              <p>Adelyn was born in Nebraska but moved to San Angelo, Texas shortly after she was born. She lived there for a few years
                before moving back to Bellevue, Nebraska, where she now lives with her family, including two
                younger sisters, and a third on the way! Her sisters are her best friends, but she keeps her most special things locked up
                in a jewelry box, away from prying fingers. Her favorite foods are pizza and Chinese food.
                At home, she prefers to spend her time either outside, swimming in the pool, or inside, coloring and reading books.</p>
              <p>Adelyn loves the outdoors, and when away from home, she frequents state parks and playgrounds, where she displays
                her prodigious talent for swinging. To put it in her own words, “I pump my feet, and it’s up in the sky!” She also makes
                regular visits to her many relatives in the area. Between her grandparents living
                close by, and her dearest cousins in Fremont, there is plenty of family to get together with.</p>
              <p>Adelyn takes great care of her younger siblings, and her plans for the future include becoming a mommy and a teacher.
                She is also considering becoming a doctor and an artist. She hopes to live in Kentucky one day, where she has more
                family and friends, and where she can be close to the Smoky Mountains.</p>

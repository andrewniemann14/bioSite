            <p>Coloring is a hobby that comes intuitively to children, and it’s a very healthy activity, as it develops fine motor skills and
              hand-eye coordination. It also stimulates artistic creativity, and improves the ability to focus. There are various mediums for coloring, the
              most common ones being crayons, markers, and colored pencils.</p>

            <p>Swimming is an enjoyable experience that can be shared with the whole family. It also carries
              with it significant benefits. Swimming is a fantastic exercise, providing both cardio and strengthening in a low-impact
              package, and it relieves stress and anxiety.

            <p>Sim driving refers to playing a racing game using at least a steering wheel and pedals, though racing “rigs” can quickly
              grow in complexity from a steering wheel clamped to a desk, to a seat mounted on a full motion simulator, surrounded
              by screens.
